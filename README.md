# the-maze-of-waze
# to do: finish gui , TSP, add node (ALL IN GUI PACKAGE) and tests
# in Dgraph add throw new RuntimeErrorException(null);? in connect function
### this project is about directed weighted graphs.
### it has the following packeges:
## dataStructure - 
### the data structure of directed weighted graph, can add nodes, delete nodes, connect nodes, get a specific node/edge.
## algorithms -
### some algorithms on graph such as:
### isConnected - returns if the graph is strongly conncted or not
### shortestPathDist - returns the weight of the shortest path between two nodes, shortestPath - returns the path of the shortest path between two nodes
### TSP - returns a path (not always optimal) between several given nodes.
## gui -
### a graphic window to show all functions above in gui.
## class diagram -
